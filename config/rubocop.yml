# Do not force public/protected/private keyword to be indented at the same
# level as the def keyword. My personal preference is to outdent these keywords
# because I think when scanning code it makes it easier to identify the
# sections of code and visually separate them. When the keyword is at the same
# level I think it sort of blends in with the def keywords and makes it harder
# to scan the code and see where the sections are.
